# Divvy-case-study
## The Data Source and Purpose

The data used in this analysis is from Divvy, a Chicago based bike share program. The data used contains bike trips data for the year 2022.

This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished': Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found [here](https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study)). The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct analysis to help answer the key question: "In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?"
